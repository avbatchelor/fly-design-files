fly-design-files
============================================
General design is: Make 3D parts as realistically as needed in Inventor (.ipt files, then generate .dwg files) or AutoCAD (.dwg), then use CAM program to set up toolpaths etc.,

## holder-profiles
* Set of fly profiles that can be milled or laser-cut from standard shim stock
* Note some are hand folded after 2D profile is cut, as demonstrated in some inventor files

## platforms
* Fit the holders from holder-profiles and are convenient for physiology and behavior
* Currently these are simply a copy of the "lab standard" holders in use

## adapters
* 3D printable adapters for transferring flies between standard containers or holding.
* (todo)

fly-design-files
============================================
General design is: Make 3D parts as realistically as needed in Inventor (.ipt files), export true-to-form drawing (.dwg) for documentation, and export a 2D .dwg or .step for easy use in Mastercam etc.,

## holder-profiles
* Set of fly profiles that can be milled or laser-cut from standard shim stock
* Note some are hand folded after 2D profile is cut

## platforms
* Fit the holders from holder-profiles and are convenient for physiology and behavior
* (todo)

## adapters
* 3D printable adapters for transferring flies between standard containers or holding.
* (todo)
